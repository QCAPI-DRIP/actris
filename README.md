# actris

A use case prototype for an ACTRIS dataset: DE0043G.20100101000000.20181114115100.cpc.particle_number_concentration.pm10.1y.1h.DE09L_TSI_CPC_3025.DE09L_cpc.lev2.nc

 A triple file is creted from the dataset attributes. The relation between the instrument filter_absorption_photometer and he variable it measures, aerosol_absorption_coefficient is recorded in the triple file.
 A sparql query displays the relation between that instrument and the variable, also shows the synonyms of that variable.

 This use case demonstrates the semantic search feasibility over the ACTRIS dataset, across multiple vocabaries.
