# actris

## A use case prototype for on an ACTRIS dataset: DE0043G.20100101000000.20181114115100.cpc.particle_number_concentration.pm10.1y.1h.DE09L_TSI_CPC_3025.DE09L_cpc.lev2.nc

### A triple file is creted from the attributes. The relation between the instrument filter_absorption_photometer and he variable it measures, aerosol_absorption_coefficient
### is recorded in the triple file.
### A sparql query displays the relation that instrument and the variable it measures, also show the synonyms of that variable.

### This use case demonstrates the semantic search feasibility over the ACTRIS dataset, across multiple vocabaries.
